# DungeoneerApp
Semester-long project intended to simulate software development lifecycle. Dungeons and Dragons campaign assistance.

This project was decided upon by a group of 5 people. It's intended function is to assist in the running of one or multiple DND campaigns. Due to the nature of the project only
being a semester long project the scope of the project was kept minimal. My primary works was on the login and logout features as well as combining everyones modules together
with the main interface.

Provided in this repository is the source code and a runnable jar file. To run the jar file simply download and execute. Ensure you have java installed on your computer.
